        <h2>Hi, I'm Luis</h2>
        <p> I'm a Civil Engineer graduated from the University of Guanajuato <a href="https://www3.ugto.mx/en/"> (UG) </a> in Guanajuato, Guanajuato, México. I'm
          curretly a PhD student in Civil Engineering with focus on Scientific Computation at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/">(HKUST)</a>. 
            <h3>Early years as Bachelor and Masters student in Civil Engineering</h3>
            Those were in total six full-time challenging years as an undergraduate student I had to udergo to obtain my degree of Civil Engineer with focus on Structural Engineering. 
            Nonetheless, what a great journey it was, not only in Mexico, but overseas as well, in top institutions. During those studies I participated in a couple of 
            international academic programs: in 2015 at Northeastern Illinois University <a href="https://www.neiu.edu/"> (NEIU) </a>, USA, at an undergraduate level, later, in 2017, at
            <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/"> Chalmers University of Technology</a>, Sweden at a graduate level, to enhance my capabilities exploring other
            scientific and engineering areas, places and ideas. Topics such as Stochastic processes, Stochastic optimization algorithms, The Finite Element Method 
            and Structural design were of the most relevant in these programs. In 2019 I obtained the degree of Civil Engineer with focus on Structural Engineering, with the publication of a thesis work about optimization
            design of reinforcing steel for concrete columns through an original mathematical numerical approach developed at
            the <a href="https://aulas.cimne.com/aula/aula-ugto/">Aula CIMNE-UG</a></h2>
            <br></br>

            <h3>Early years in research as a Masters student in Structural Engineering</h3>
            In 2020, my professional carreer and research continued with a Master's program in Science
            of Structures at the Autonomous University of Queretaro <a href="https://www.uaq.mx/index.php"> (UAQ)</a>, in which I could learn a lot more in the area of 
            computaitonal mechanics, numerical methods, engineering software development and optimal/sustainable design
            of civil infrastructure projects and structures, mainly of reinforced concrete.  In 2022 I obtained my Masters degree
            in Science of Structures. It was during these studies when
            I realized that I wanted to do Research for the rest of my life, and from this point on my carrer was divided
            into two main paths: research and industry.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
            Right after my Masters studies at the Autonomous University of Queretaro I went to the <a href="https://www.cimat.mx/">CIMAT</a> (Centro de
            de Investigación en Matemáticas - Research Center in Mathematics) in Guanajuato city, Mexico, to continue my carrer path in the Graduate Department of
            Computational Science by learning more about Prorgramming, Algorithms, Parallel Computing, Numerical methods and Data Science. During these studies I could develop a research work
            related to optimization algorithms based on Combinatorial-Mathematics for the design of asymmetrical rebar in rectangular columns, which then led to additional research 
            works related to optimization design of Irregular reinforced concrete buildings. <br><br>

            In 2023 I was accepted at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/">(HKUST)</a> for my PhD studies in Civil Engineering
            with focus in Scientific Computation. Here at the HKUST I focus in the area of Machine Learning, Structural Reliability and Numerical modelling for 
            structural design and optimization.

        </p>
        <h3>Industry</h3>
        <p>
          Even though research is my priority when referring to my professional carrer I keep on involving myself in infrastructure projects 
          in the private industry along with my father and my brother as a company. We perform structural designs, topographyc surveys, construction plans and budgets. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I usually come across with very interesting ideas by doing these sort of works. Thus, it is vital for me now to be always linked, to the industrial sector, 
          somehow, to enhance my research topics and scope.
