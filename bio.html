        <h2>Hi, I'm Luis</h2>
        <p> I'm a Civil Engineer graduated from the University of Guanajuato (UG) in Guanajuato, Guanajuato, México. 
            During those studies I participated in a couple of 
            international academic programs at Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), USA - in 2015, and at
            Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden - in 2017, to enhance my capabilities exploring other
            scientific and engineering areas, places and ideas, by taking both undergraduate and graduated
            courses related to stochastic processes, stochastic optimization algorithms, The Finite Element Method 
            and Structural design. In 2019 I obtained my Bachelor Degree in Civil Engineering with a Thesis work about optimization
            design of reinforcing steel for concrete columns through an original mathematical numerical approach developed at
            the Aula CIMNE-UG. <br></br>

            Later, in 2020, my professional carrer and research continued during my Master's program in Science
            of Structures at the Autonomous University of Queretaro, in which I could learn a lot more in the area of 
            computaitonal mechanics, numerical methods, engineering software development and optimal/sustainable design
            of civil infrastructure projects and structures, mainly of reinforced concrete.  In 2022 I obtained my Degree
            in Master of Science (Structures). It was during these studies when
            I realized that I wanted to do Research for the rest of my life, and from this point on my carrer was divided
            into two paths: research and industry.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
            Right after my Master's studies at the Autonomous University of Queretaro I went to the CIMAT (Centro de
            de Investigación en Matemáticas - Research Center in Mathematics) in Guanajuato city, Mexico, to continue my carrer path in the Graduate Department of
            Computational Science by learning more about Prorgramming, Algorithms, Parallel Computing, Numerical methods and Data Science. During these studies I could develop a research work
            related to optimization algorithms based on Combinatorial-Mathematics for the design of asymmetrical rebar in rectangular columns, which then led to additional research 
            works related to optimization design of Irregular reinforced concrete <br><br>

            In 2023 I was accepted at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) for my PhD studies in Civil Engineering
            with focus in Scientific Computation. A great journey awaits for me in the area of Artiicial Intelligence and Numerical modelling for 
            structural design and optimization.

        </p>
        <h3>Industry</h3>
        <p>
          Even though research is my priority when referring to my professional carrer I keep on involving myself in infrastructure projects 
          in the private industry along with my father and my brother as a company. We perform structural designs, topographyc surveys, construction plans and budgets. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I usually come across with very interesting ideas by doing these wort of works. Thus, it is vital for me now to always be linked to the industrial sector 
          somehow to enhance my research topics and scope.
