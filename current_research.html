        <h2>Maintanance and development of CALRECOD</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>As the creator of CALRECOD it is my resposibility to keep on developing new functions for further 
              versions of CALRECOD. At this point new functionalities for the optimal design of hollow concrete
              columns is are being developed as well as for the design of prestressed concrete beams.</li>

        <h2>Geometrical Non-Linear influence of asymmetrical reinforcement in slender concrete columns in their moment amplification factors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Asymmetrical reinforcement in concrete columns has demonstrated to be a great practice to 
              reduced envrionmental impacts from the construction of reinforced concrete columns. 
              It is thus vital to keep on developing research related to this design approach for future
              codes to consider it in their guidelines.</li>
